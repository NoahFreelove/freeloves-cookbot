# Freelove's Cook bot

*This app is completely vibecoded with Claude Opus 4.6, but it has been useful to me, so I*
 *publish it in hopes its useful to someone else too.*

I love cooking and baking, I use LLMs to generate or clean up a lot of my recipes because online recipe websites
have so much slop and just so many ads. To get to the recipe you have to scroll down two pages
of about the author and dismiss 8 video ads. And if you have a question you're likely going to an LLM anyway!

I have too many recipes I enjoy generated, I'd love to host them somewhere so I can reference
them. But I also would appreciate it if ones I generate could just be saved in some standardized
format too, so I made this app.

This is a cooking and baking tracking app. 

This app can be self hosted completely. It uses Blazor and SQLite

It has AI chatbot integration if you wish to use an anthropic api key, but it also has a
prompt generator which you can just put into whichever AI agent you like best so you don't
have to pay extra.


You can also track your pantry i.e your ingredients to see if you have enough stuff to make
a recipe. It also features shopping lists, multi user support, You can add a password to your
account if you'd like, but this is really meant for self-hosting so hopefully nobody super evil
is on your network.


I'd like to implement some more features like smarter food expiration tracking, recipe
substitutions, and export features.
